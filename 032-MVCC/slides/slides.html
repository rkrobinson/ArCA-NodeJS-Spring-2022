    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

    data-transition-duration="1000"

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <h1>MVC(C)</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <br /><br />
        Model–View–Controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing applications that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.
        
        <div class="notes">

    <div id="model" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Model</h1>
        <br />
        <p>The model is the layer that manages your data. In a web application this usually would be the component that interacts with the database. All requests for data queries or changes should go through the model.</p>
        
        <div class="notes">
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="view" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>View</h1>
        <p>The view is the interface that a user sees and interacts with. So, normally HTML/CSS/JS in a web application.</p>
        
        <div class="notes">

    </div>
    
    <div id="controller" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Controller</h1>
        <p>The controller is the intermediary layer between the user and the model. Controllers accept requests from users and translate them into commands for the model. This name corresponds exactly to the "controllers" we created in Kraken and aligns with API endpoints. The controller can also affect the view. For example, if a view (UI) requests data from a controller, which queries it from the model, that data is probably going to be displayed or used in the view.</p>

    <div id="mvc" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>Simply...</h1>
        <p>The model manages all access to your data, the user "sees" the view, and the user "uses" the controller.</p>
        
        <div class="notes">

    </div>

    <div id="coordinator" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1>The Extra "C" - Coordinators</h1>
        <p>Outside of the standard MVC model is the idea of a "coordinator". A coordinator is just another layer of abstraction that helps us compartmentalize our application logic. The coordinator layer is inserted between the controller and model. So, user invokes a controller, controller calls coordinator, coordinator calls model, then data manipulation is done in the model and returned.</p>

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
