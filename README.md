# **Arkansas Coding Academy - Node.js and MongoDB (Spring 2022)**
## **Course Description**
Learn real world uses for Node.js and MongoDB as we start at an introductory level then progress through intermediate and advanced applications.  This course will focus on flexible utilities, scalable REST API development and integration, task automation, comprehensive testing, dependency management, library creation and publishing, and using MongoDB for storing and analyzing data with NoSQL.  UI design, implementation, and client-side applications will also be covered.
All of the lesson outlines and presentations can be found in [Github course project repository](https://github.com/carpaltunnel/ArCA-NodeJS-Spring-2022)

## **Software Prerequisites**
### **Operating System**
Due to the portable nature of Node.js any mainstream OS including Linux, MacOS, and Windows will be sufficient.  

### **Browser**
Any modern browser should work but since Node.js uses the Google V8 engine, [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is recommended.

### **Node.js**
To make use of powerful recent additions to Node.js, this course will require v12.0 or newer.  I suggest the newest version of the v14 branch.  You can find the appropriate install package for your operating system on the [Node.js Download Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  Older versions can be found in the [archives](https://nodejs.org/dist/) if needed.  We'll be coding in the ES6 format but comparisons to older versions will be presented for historical context since you will come across them in the wild.

### **Development Environment (IDE)**
Any text editor can be used for Node.js development but an IDE will make everything easier.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is recommended because it is free, open source, extremely poweful/flexible, and will run on most modern operating systems.  There are many [keyboard shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) than can improve the user experience.

These VSCode extensions may make development easier :
1. [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify) - Code formatter
2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - Linter
3. [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)



### **MongoDB**
MongoDB v4.4 or newer will be used for this course.  The Community version is free and can be found on the [MongoDB Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).  [Robo3T](https://robomongo.org/download) is a lightweight client that can be used to query MongoDB.

### **Git**
Source control will be managed by [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and references will be provided on [Github](https://github.com/carpaltunnel/ArCA-NodeJS-Spring-2022). All required git functionality can be completed using only the command line but GUIs such as [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and others are available.  They are no required since Git functionality is built into VS Code and we will mostly use this.

## Course Repository Structure
The [Github course project repository](https://github.com/carpaltunnel/ArCA-NodeJS-Spring-2022) is structured with directories for each lesson in *###-Title* format.  In each directory you will find a `README.md` in Markdown format that will cover the lesson topics at a high level.  These READMEs are helpful for getting a general idea what we'll discuss in each lesson, as well as a quick reference in the future.  You'll also find a *slides* directory that will contain effectively the same content as the README but in a presentation format.  We'll use the presentation during class to ensure we stay on topic, don't miss any important points, and provide the information in an easier to digest visual format.

*Note* : While each folder represents a logical "lesson", it might not correlate to a single class session.  Depending on velocity, one lesson may take multiple class sessions to cover, or we may cover multiple logical lessons in a single class session.  Use it as a general guide but don't expect it to be 100% accurate when it comes to which topics will be covered in each class block.
