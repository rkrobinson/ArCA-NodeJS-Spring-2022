    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    The width, height, scale and perspective options define a target screen size that you should
    design your CSS against. impress.js will automatically scale all content to different screen
    sizes. See DOCUMENTATION.md for details. Below, I have targeted full HD screen resolution.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.

        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

        <p>In this lesson we'll cover variables in more depth.  Specifically, common "gotchas" and more reasons to avoid <code>var</code></p>

    </div>

    <div id="const1" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1><code>const</code> ... and when it's not</h1>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
            const myObject = {
                myString: 'test string',
                myNumber: 42,
              };
            const myArray = [];
            
            myObject.myBoolean = true;
            myArray.push(1);
            myArray.push(2);
            myArray.push(3);

        <p>The important part is that const's can not be reassigned.</p>

    <div id="const2" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">

                myString: 'test string',
                myNumber: 42,
              };
              
            myObject = 1; // Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'myObject'

    <div id="var-hoist" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1><code>var</code> Hoisting</h1>
        <p><code>var</code>'s are "hoisted" to the top of their scope</p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
            myTest = 'a test';
            console.log('The value of undeclared variable myTest is ' + myTest);
            var myTest = 'declared here';
            console.log('The value of declared variable myTest is ' + myTest);
        </code></pre>

        <p><code>myTest</code> appears to be used before being declared due to hoisting.  Don't use <code>var</code>.</p>
        
        <div class="notes">

    </div>

    <div id="null-vs-undefined" class="step slide" data-rel-x="2200" data-rel-y="0">
        <h1><code>null</code> Versus <code>undefined</code></h1>
        <p>Null is "empty" or non-existent and must be assigned.  Undefined means that a variable has been declared but has never been assigned and is therefore not defined.</p>

        <pre><code class="javascript">
            const iAmNull = null;
            let iAmUndefined;
            console.log(iAmNull); // null
            console.log(iAmUndefined); // undefined
        </code></pre>

        <p>Note that const declarations require initialization.  Using <code>const</code> before <code>iAmUndefined</code> would result in a Syntax Error.</p>

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->
